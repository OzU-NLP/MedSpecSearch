# MedSpecSearch

MedSpecSearch (www.medspecsearch.com) is a search en-
gine for helping users to find the relevant medical specialty for a doctor

visit based on usersâ€™ description of symptoms. This system is useful for
users who are not sure of which medical specialty they should consult to.
Furthermore, the API (available at www.github) of the search engine can

be used as part of the online doctor appointment and medical consulta-
tion sites to route the patient or question to the right medical specialty.

The system returns the top 3 relevant specialties when the estimated
confidence score is high. Otherwise it asks users to input more data.
